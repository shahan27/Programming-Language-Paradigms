* Racket is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language based on the Scheme dialect of Lisp. It is designed to be a platform for programming language design and implementation.[8] In addition to the core Racket language, Racket is also used to refer to the family of Racket programming languages[9] and the set of tools supporting development on and with Racket.[10] Racket is also used for scripting, computer science education, and research.
