;should return true because a is a symbol by the quote
;(symbol? 'a)


;should return false cause a is not a symbol
;(eq? a 'b)
;this did not run becuase a is not a symbol and the precondition of eq? must have two symbols
;therefore the line above did not run

;this edited version should run and return false because both symbols are not the same.

;(eq? 'a 'b)

;should return false cause both symbols are different
;(eq? 'a 'b)

;should return true because a are the same symbol
;(eq? 'a 'a)


;;;All Correct

;(cons '(a) '())

;(append '(a) '())

;(cons '(a) 'b)

;(define x (list 3 4 5 6 7))

(define x '(a b ((3) c) d))

(car (cdr x))

(cdaddr x) ;i dont understand why this returns (c)

(char? (car '(#\a #\b))) ;I dont understand why this is a char

(cons 'x x)

(cons (list 1 2) (cons 3 '(4)))

(cons (list) (list 1 (cons 2 '())))
;(list) is an empty list
